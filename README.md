# Data-Structures-Project

Project developed for the course Algorithms and Data Structures during the realization of the Master of Applied Sciences and Engineering: Applied Computer Science at the Vrije Universiteit Brussels. 

This project consists of the creation of a Real State Management System that allows to store different types of real estates, e.g. houses and apartments and clients. The Management System also allows us to organize visits to properties. The code is written in Java programming language.

In order to store this objects, different data structures are used optimizing the use and needs of each property. These data structures are implemented in the project itself, where we can find the following:


* Linked List
* Queue
* Priority Queue
* Stack
* Vector
* Binary Search Tree
* Graph
